How to create a Telegram Bot with Python.

## Getting started
First of all, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a text editor to code your bot. I suggest you to use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) because it's my favourite one due to its minimalism, but every text editor/IDE is okay. 
Then, you must have a Telegram account and then get the **token** to access the Telegram bot, using [@BotFather](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@BotFather).
